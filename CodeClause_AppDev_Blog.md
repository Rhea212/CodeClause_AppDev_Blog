# TRENDING TECHNOLOGIES FOR MOBILE APPLICATION DEVELOPMENT

Mobile application development has progressed a lot over the years. With the increased demands and improvements in smartphones, there was also a need to improve the application development process. With advancements in technology, developers now have access to powerful tools and frameworks that make it easier than ever to create high-quality mobile apps. Some of these technologies have been discussed below.

*	Java

One of the most popular object-oriented programming languages that is practically used everywhere is java.  It has a number of libraries, packages and tools which makes it a mature and stable language. It is also easy to learn and has cross-platform compatibility. Consequently, it has been used for Android development for many years, and popular apps like Twitter and OperaMini were written in Java. In recent years, Kotlin has emerged as a contender to Java. 

*	Kotlin

Being an open-source and simple language, Kotlin has gained much popularity recently. It was developed by JetBrains and is capable of building Android, iOS and web applications. Kotlin is modern and concise, and has features that enable faster coding. It is also interoperable with Java, which makes it easy to integrate into existing Java projects. Google announced Kotlin as a first-class language for Android development which has further made people adopt it over Java. Its range of features is an added advantage.

*	React Native

Developed by Facebook, React Native allows developers to build native mobile apps using JavaScript and React. It is a popular framework for building mobile apps among those who come from a web development background especially. It offered faster development times, cross-platform compatibility, and a large developer community. One can build iOS and Android apps using a single codebase with React Native. 

*	Flutter

Developed by Google, Flutter uses a reactive programming model to build beautiful, high-performance user interfaces. It is an open-source UI toolkit that can be used to make mobile, web and desktop applications. Like React Native, Flutter also allows building iOS and Android apps using a single codebase. Some of its most popular features are hot reload, which allows developers to see changes instantly, and a customizable widget set that makes it easy to build beautiful interfaces.
*	Emerging Technologies

1.	Blockchain

This technology is offering increased security and privacy for apps. Due to its decentralized and secure nature, it can be used to strengthen sensitive processes like payment gateways, identity verification systems, and secure data storage solutions.

2.  Artificial Intelligence (AI)

Rise of AI has provided the means to make mobile apps smarter and more personalised. AI can be used to create intelligent chatbots, personalized recommendations, and predictive analytics solutions. This has enabled apps to provide better ads and recommendations.

In conclusion, mobile application development is an ever-improving and relevant field. New technologies are constantly being developed, so one must remain aware and up-to-date. Although this blog provides highlights of most technologies, one must experiment and research before choosing for themselves. In the near future, mobile application development will become more simplified with stronger tools.
